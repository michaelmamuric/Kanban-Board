# Kanban Board

This app is a simplified version of a [Kanban Board](https://kanbanize.com/kanban-resources/getting-started/what-is-kanban-board), created using React.

Deployed on Heroku at [https://easy-kanban-board.herokuapp.com/](https://easy-kanban-board.herokuapp.com/)

* **Backlog** - Tasks that are not yet done. When a user adds a new task, it automatically gets assigned to this category.
* **In Progress** - Tasks that are currently being completed.
* **Done** - Tasks that are completed.
